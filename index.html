        <p>The problem
            Taiwan, a country of quick infrastructure over the years and a booming economy is all great until it interferes with the country's climate and ecosystem. Taiwan has had issues over the years, from its habitat and water systems all being compromised due to the lack of care for the environment. The water systems take a big hit and have the most important impact on people's lives in Taiwan. They only have their own water supplies being that they're an island

        <h3>Acid Rain</h3>
    </section>
    <section id="grid-right">
        <p>Acid rain is a byproduct of climate change and does more harm than you think to life. Acid rain is rain that has lower pH levels compared to normal rain and or regular drinking water. This rain has an effect on so many things; From quicker decay of buildings and objects that encounter it to crops. Acid rain also creates issues with the air as it pollutes the air and releases small particles that can cause respiratory problems for sensitive people and could even create new problems for others. Crops are at risk and in Taiwan a country that enjoys vegetables like rice. Due to acid rain rice is a  product that is losing its nutritional value due to the decreased pH levels of the soil.</p>

        <h3>Flooding</h3>
    </section>
    <section class="grid-right">
        <p>Flooding is having a massive impact on Taiwan. Typhoons transpire more often due to the rising global temperatures. This happens due to trapped greenhouse gasses that are released into the earth's atmosphere and affecting the weather cycles. Flooding is a more visual tragedy, it's not something hiding in the air and damaging our lives slowly. Flooding destroys all advances of humans from destroying homes and businesses to destroying and killing crops, livestock, and humans. All these are happening more and more often due to our climate change issues this makes rebuilding a hassle and costly.
