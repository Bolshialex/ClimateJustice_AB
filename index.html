                <h3 >The Problem</h3>
                <p>The problem
                    Taiwan, a country of quick infrastructure over the years and a booming economy is all great until it interferes 
                    with the country's climate and ecosystem. Taiwan has had issues over the years, from its habitat and water systems 
                    all being compromised due to the lack of care for the environment. The water systems take a big hit and have the 
                    most important impact on people's lives in Taiwan.

                <h3>Water Pollution</h3>

                <p>Water pollution has a hold on Taiwan due to their common floods and typhoons increasing run-off pollution and 
                    increasing chemicals and other harmful bacteria in water systems. Not only the natural but also the human issues of pollution.
                    From the quick industrial rise and the lack of care for its failing systems from Taiwans leaders. This all affects drinking water and freshwater 
                    sources which also play a role in crops, livestock and the survivability and quality of these products and their people.

                <h3>Tech's Help</h3>
                <p> 
                    Technology plays its role in many of the systems created to clean and filtrate water. These all require programming and development to ensure they succeed in their job. These systems read the water and test its quality. Other programs have formulas in machines that mix compounds and clean water in large amounts. Developers are critical thinkers and they have the knowledge to work with others (leaders, politicians and scientists) on these issues and help find solutions. There are endless ways for tech to help clean this world and many still on the way. <br> Click <a href="https://www.wateronline.com/doc/how-water-sanitation-technology-brings-people-clean-water-efficiently-0001" target="_blank">here</a> for more examples.
